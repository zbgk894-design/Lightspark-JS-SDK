# Grid offramp scripts

Step-by-step guide for the **USDB embedded wallet → USD bank** offramp flow,
plus onboarding and the on-ramp (USD → USDB) for completeness. Most steps
are plain HTTP calls; the only operations that aren't expressible in curl
are HPKE bundle decrypt and Turnkey API stamp construction, which live in
[`embedded-wallet-sign.js`](./embedded-wallet-sign.js) (using
`@turnkey/crypto` and `@turnkey/api-key-stamper`).

> **For production integrations**, prefer the official Grid SDKs at
> <https://docs.lightspark.com>. This README is intended for hands-on
> tinkering, debugging, and end-to-end validation — it favors curl and
> the minimal signing helpers over a full SDK stack.

## Prereqs

Install once:

```bash
cd scripts && npm install
```

Then set credentials:

```bash
export GRID_BASE_URL="https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13"
export GRID_CLIENT_ID="<your client id>"
export GRID_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"

SIGN="node $(pwd)/scripts/embedded-wallet-sign.js"
g() { curl -s -u "$GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET" "$@"; }
```

`$SIGN --help` lists the four subcommands. `g` is a shorthand for
authenticated curl used throughout the snippets below.

## 1. Onboarding

### 1.1 Create a customer

```bash
g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "customerType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "platformCustomerId": "your-id-here",
    "umaAddress": "$alice@yourplatform.example",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "fullName": "Alice Example",
    "birthDate": "1990-01-15",
    "nationality": "US"
  }' "$GRID_BASE_URL/customers" | jq .
```

Capture the returned `id` (e.g. `Customer:01...`) into `$CUSTOMER_ID`.

### 1.2 Wait for KYC / KYB approval

Internal accounts auto-provision **after** approval.

- **`INDIVIDUAL` customers** are auto-KYC'd today — they jump straight to
  `kycStatus: "APPROVED"` on creation, so there's nothing to wait for.
- **`BUSINESS` customers** start at `kybStatus: "UNVERIFIED"` and require
  an out-of-band verification step. Poll until approved:

  ```bash
  g "$GRID_BASE_URL/customers/$CUSTOMER_ID" | jq '{kybStatus}'
  ```

### 1.3 Find the embedded-wallet accounts

After approval, two internal accounts appear (USDB embedded wallet + USD):

```bash
g "$GRID_BASE_URL/customers/internal-accounts?customerId=$CUSTOMER_ID" \
  | jq '.data[] | {id, currency: .balance.currency.code, type}'
```

Capture the **USDB account id** into `$USDB_ACCT`.

### 1.4 Bootstrap the embedded wallet (issue the EMAIL_OTP challenge)

> **Required before the first quote.** The USDB embedded wallet's Turnkey
> sub-org and Spark network wallet aren't fully provisioned at customer
> creation time. Challenging and later verifying the auto-created auth
> credential triggers that bootstrap. Skipping causes the first on-ramp quote to fail with
> `to_network INTERNAL_FUNDED_FIAT does not support USDB`.

An `EMAIL_OTP` credential is automatically created when the embedded wallet
is provisioned. Find it and issue a challenge to send the OTP email:

```bash
CRED_ID=$(g "$GRID_BASE_URL/auth/credentials?accountId=$USDB_ACCT" \
  | jq -r '.data[] | select(.type=="EMAIL_OTP") | .id')

g -X POST "$GRID_BASE_URL/auth/credentials/$CRED_ID/challenge"
```

This sends an OTP email to the address on the customer record. Keep the code
handy; you'll use it for the offramp signing step (3.3) within the OTP TTL
(~5 min). If it expires, re-issue via `/challenge` (3.2).

### 1.5 Add a destination bank (USD external account)

```bash
g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "'$CUSTOMER_ID'",
    "currency": "USD",
    "accountInfo": {
      "accountType": "USD_ACCOUNT",
      "paymentRails": ["RTP"],
      "routingNumber": "121042882",
      "accountNumber": "0000000000",
      "beneficiary": {
        "beneficiaryType": "INDIVIDUAL",
        "fullName": "Alice Example",
        "birthDate": "1990-01-15",
        "nationality": "US"
      }
    }
  }' "$GRID_BASE_URL/customers/external-accounts" | jq .
```

Capture the returned `id` (e.g. `ExternalAccount:01...`) into `$BANK_ID`.

## 2. On-ramp ($1 USD → 1 USDB)

The platform funds USD into its own internal USD account first (real wire /
ACH / RTP — out of scope for this script). Once the platform USD account
has a balance, drive a quote from platform USD → customer USDB. No signing
needed.

```bash
PLATFORM_USD=$(g "$GRID_BASE_URL/platform/internal-accounts?currency=USD" \
  | jq -r '.data[0].id')

QUOTE=$(g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "source":      {"sourceType": "ACCOUNT", "accountId": "'$PLATFORM_USD'"},
    "destination": {"destinationType": "ACCOUNT", "accountId": "'$USDB_ACCT'", "currency": "USDB"},
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100
  }' "$GRID_BASE_URL/quotes")
QUOTE_ID=$(echo "$QUOTE" | jq -r .id)
TXN_ID=$(echo "$QUOTE" | jq -r .transactionId)

g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' \
  "$GRID_BASE_URL/quotes/$QUOTE_ID/execute" | jq '.status'

while :; do
  S=$(g "$GRID_BASE_URL/transactions/$TXN_ID" | jq -r .status)
  echo "$S"
  [ "$S" = "COMPLETED" ] || [ "$S" = "FAILED" ] && break
  sleep 2
done
```

## 3. Off-ramp (USDB → USD bank)

The customer's embedded wallet must produce a Turnkey-stamped signature
over a `payloadToSign` returned by the quote. Step 1.4 already registered
the credential — we just need a fresh OTP and an ephemeral keypair.

### 3.1 Generate an ephemeral keypair (TEK)

Generate a fresh P-256 pair (the TEK — Target Encryption Key) for this
session. The public key is encrypted inside the OTP bundle; the private key
becomes the session signing key after successful verify.

```bash
$SIGN gen-keypair > /tmp/keys.json
PUB_HEX=$(jq -r .pubHex /tmp/keys.json)
PRIV_HEX=$(jq -r .privHex /tmp/keys.json)
```

### 3.2 (Re-)issue an OTP and get the encryption target

To get a fresh OTP (after expiry or for a new session):

```bash
CHALLENGE=$(g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' \
  "$GRID_BASE_URL/auth/credentials/$CRED_ID/challenge")
OTP_TARGET=$(echo "$CHALLENGE" | jq -r .otpEncryptionTargetBundle)
```

Read the OTP code from the email and assign to `$OTP`.

> **Sandbox tip**: in sandbox mode, no email is sent — use the fixed
> OTP code `000000`.

### 3.3 Build the encrypted OTP bundle

HPKE-encrypt `{otp_code, public_key}` to the target bundle:

```bash
ENC_BUNDLE=$($SIGN encrypt-otp "$OTP_TARGET" "$PUB_HEX" "$OTP")
```

### 3.4 Verify (two-step) and obtain the session

The first verify call returns 202 with a `payloadToSign`. Sign it with the
TEK private key and retry with headers:

```bash
# First leg — get the verification challenge
VERIFY1=$(g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type": "EMAIL_OTP", "encryptedOtpBundle": '"$ENC_BUNDLE"'}' \
  "$GRID_BASE_URL/auth/credentials/$CRED_ID/verify")

VERIFY_PAYLOAD=$(echo "$VERIFY1" | jq -r .payloadToSign)
VERIFY_REQ_ID=$(echo "$VERIFY1" | jq -r .requestId)

# Sign the verification token with the TEK private key
VERIFY_STAMP=$($SIGN stamp "$PRIV_HEX" "$VERIFY_PAYLOAD")

# Signed retry — complete login
VERIFY2=$(g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Grid-Wallet-Signature: $VERIFY_STAMP" \
  -H "Request-Id: $VERIFY_REQ_ID" \
  -d '{"type": "EMAIL_OTP", "encryptedOtpBundle": '"$ENC_BUNDLE"'}' \
  "$GRID_BASE_URL/auth/credentials/$CRED_ID/verify")

echo "Session expires: $(echo "$VERIFY2" | jq -r .expiresAt)"

# The TEK private key IS the session signing key — no decryption needed
SESSION_PRIV_HEX="$PRIV_HEX"
```

Sessions are short-lived (~15 min). Cache `$SESSION_PRIV_HEX` and run the
remaining steps before it expires; otherwise re-run `gen-keypair` →
`/challenge` → `encrypt-otp` → `/verify`.

### 3.5 Create the offramp quote

```bash
QUOTE=$(g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "source":      {"sourceType": "ACCOUNT", "accountId": "'$USDB_ACCT'"},
    "destination": {"destinationType": "ACCOUNT", "accountId": "'$BANK_ID'", "currency": "USD"},
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 1000000
  }' "$GRID_BASE_URL/quotes")

QUOTE_ID=$(echo "$QUOTE" | jq -r .id)
TXN_ID=$(echo "$QUOTE" | jq -r .transactionId)
PAYLOAD=$(echo "$QUOTE" \
  | jq -r '.paymentInstructions[].accountOrWalletInfo
           | select(.accountType=="EMBEDDED_WALLET").payloadToSign')
```

The quote response returns **both** signing/funding options in
`paymentInstructions`:

```json
"paymentInstructions": [
  { "accountOrWalletInfo": { "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
                             "address": "spark1...",
                             "invoice": "spark1..." } },
  { "accountOrWalletInfo": { "accountType": "EMBEDDED_WALLET",
                             "payloadToSign": "{...}" } }
]
```

These are alternatives — pick one:

- **`EMBEDDED_WALLET` path** (this README): debits the customer's existing
  on-chain USDB balance. Needs a Turnkey-stamped signature over
  `payloadToSign`.
- **`SPARK_WALLET` path**: pay USDB into the `invoice` from any external
  Spark wallet. No stamp needed; the deposit drives the offramp once
  detected. Used by `test_token_offramp_e2e` via
  `spark-cli fulfillsparkinvoice`.

### 3.6 Stamp the payload

```bash
STAMP=$($SIGN stamp "$SESSION_PRIV_HEX" "$PAYLOAD")
```

### 3.7 Execute

```bash
g -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -H "Grid-Wallet-Signature: $STAMP" \
   -d '{}' \
   "$GRID_BASE_URL/quotes/$QUOTE_ID/execute" | jq '.status'
```

> **Sandbox tip**: sandbox accepts the same decrypted session signing key and
> `Grid-Wallet-Signature` stamp shape as production. The legacy fixed value
> `Grid-Wallet-Signature: sandbox-valid-signature` is still accepted for
> compatibility, but it does not exercise the production-shaped client path.

```bash
# Poll — typically 60–180s for the full chain to reach COMPLETED.
while :; do
  S=$(g "$GRID_BASE_URL/transactions/$TXN_ID" | jq -r .status)
  echo "$S"
  [ "$S" = "COMPLETED" ] || [ "$S" = "FAILED" ] && break
  sleep 5
done
```

On `COMPLETED`, the user's bank receives the USD via RTP.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `to_network INTERNAL_FUNDED_FIAT does not support USDB` on the first on-ramp quote | Embedded wallet not bootstrapped. Register an EMAIL_OTP credential first (step 1.4). |
| `EMAIL_OTP_CREDENTIAL_ALREADY_EXISTS` on `POST /auth/credentials` | The wallet already has a credential. Use `POST /auth/credentials/{id}/challenge` to re-issue an OTP. |
| `No pending OTP for this credential` on `/verify` | OTP expired (typically ~5 min). Re-run `/challenge` and verify quickly. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` on offramp quote create | USDB on-chain balance at the embedded wallet's Spark address is below the requested amount. The Grid book balance can be ahead of the chain — check the on-chain side via `spark-cli` or your Spark explorer. |
| Execute returns 500 / "INTERNAL_ERROR" | Often: bad `Grid-Wallet-Signature`. Verify `$SESSION_PRIV_HEX` matches the active session and `$PAYLOAD` is the exact `payloadToSign` byte string. |
| Txn stuck in `PROCESSING` indefinitely | Grid build pre-dates the SP-2912 fix, or paycore detection of the on-chain Spark deposit hasn't fired. Check paycore worker logs. |
